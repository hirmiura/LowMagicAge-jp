lma_bg=[[After the fallen of the ancient arcane empires, the golden age of magic has come to an end. Most of spells and related knowledge have been lost, even enchanted items have become scarce and precious.

However there is always a blessing in disguise. The low tide of magic has also brought an unprecedented development of traditional fighting technics, and all the combat tricks and tactics have made great progress. More and more adventurers, mercenaries and bounty hunters joined the torrent of change. Even the mages originally hidden in their spiral towers have joined the battlefield with spell books and daggers in hands.

In such an era, you and your companions pick up longswords of heirloom, mutter the spells that almost extinct, and start your journey of adventures...]]


cmt_101=[[<b> </b>

<h3 c=ty>1. Turn-based combat</h3>
When the combat begins, all the characters start their turns following the sequence of their initiative checks. After a character finished all his actions, his turn ended and switch to the next one. When all combatants have ended their turns, one round is finished and the fastest combatant starts his turn again. Repeat such steps until the combat ends, which means one group of the combatants have all lost their combat capabilities.


<h3 c=ty>2. Acts with strategy</h3>
A character can take two actions per turn: one <c=y>Standard Action</c> and one <c=g>Move Action</c>. Attacking and casting a spell are normally standard actions, while simpler actions such as moving and switching weapons are move actions.

A typical combat technic is moving into an adjacent square of an enemy and attacking him. If you are already adjacent to the enemy, you can just stay where you are (or shift, see below) and make your <c=y>Full-turn Attack</c>. Such an attack will automatically consume both your standard and move actions and is more powerful!


<h3 c=ty>3. Beware of <c=r>Attacks of Opportunity</c> from enemies!</h3>
It is dangerous to be distracted with other things and let down your guard during a fierce fighting. The nearby opponents will aim at your weak point and land a crushing blow! Such kind of triggered free attacks are called <c=r>Attacks of Opportunity</c>.

Some actions will provoke opportunity attacks, such as moving, ranged attack and spell-casting.

Think twice before you shooting an adjacent enemy or just evacuating from him. Using <c=g>Shift</c> well could help you to safely retreat.


Go ahead, and seek for more combat technics by yourself among blood and steel...]]


arena=[[Welcome to the Arena, freshman!


As a newbie, you could start your challenges simply with the default party. Or create your own characters first.

<b c=lbl>Preparation for Battles: </b>It is not allowed to use backpacks in combat. Only backup weapons are available. So prepare carefully before fighting.

<b c=lbl>Auto Recovery: </b>Fallen characters will be revived automatically after a battle. And the whole party will be restored to the best condition, too.

<b c=lbl>Purchasing Equipment: </b>Go checking the Shop often. The goods will refresh whenever you win a battle.

<b c=lbl>Endless Challenges: </b>Refresh the arena when you accomplished one set of challenges. As your party levels up, there will be more and stronger opponents awaits you!


That's it. Let the battle begin!]]

s_hlp_basics="The Basics"
s_hlp_basics_d=[[
<s b=c:ty><b>The Core Mechanic:</b> Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20).

To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:
• Roll a d20.
• Add any relevant modifiers.
• Compare the result to a target number.

If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds.

If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.


<b>Dice:</b> Dice rolls are described with expressions such as “3d4+3,” which means “roll three four-sided dice and add 3” (resulting in a number between 6 and 15).

The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together).

The number immediately after the “d” tells you the type of die to use.

Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.


<b>d%:</b> Percentile dice work a little differently.

You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice.

One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit.

Two 0s represent 100.


<b>Rounding Ractions:</b> In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.

<b c=tw>Exception:</b> Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.


<b>Multiplying:</b> Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll.


As long as you’re applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally.


When two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple.

Thus, a double (×2) and a double (×2) applied to the same number results in a triple (×3, because 2 + 1 = 3).


When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance), normal rules of math apply instead.

A creature whose size doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal.

Similarly, a blinded creature attempting to negotiate difficult terrain would count each square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for a total multiplier of ×4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice).

poorlunch_tips={n="Appendix 1: Quotations of the loot-hunter",d=[[Poorlunch, the legendary adventurer still on active duty, is the idol of many young adventurers. In addition to his superb fighting skills and epic life experience, his willingness of helping and sharing with youths is also one important reason for the respect and worship.

Strangely, he always answers very shortly whenever other adventurers ask him questions. Sometimes he splits the answer into two parts although it should be a paragraph, and one has to ask him twice...

The reason remains unknown, and curious adventures have to make their own speculations:
Some say that it is the sequela of being dominated for too long during his last combat with a demilich;
Some say that the decline of magic weave has greatly affected epic adventurers;
However, recently a fast-spreading surmise seems quite credible, that Poorlunch thinks too much words simply delays loot-hunting!

Anyway, let us just ignore his odd personal habit, and listen to his concise and beneficial quotations:


* Ranged feats apply to thrown weapons.

* Magical thrown weapons return.

* Clerics, go throwing clubs.

* Dual-wielding hand-crossbows.

* Leveling up gains no more attacks. Just stronger.

* 10 levels is a tier. Base weapon/spell damage multiplies. Weapon specialization feats also.

* Full-turn attack: +2 bonus to attack and damage, damage multiplies with tier.

* Shift: Not an action. Can apply full-turn attacks. Cannot move.

* Charge: Straight or diagonal, two squares, flat path, melee attacks.

* Spell-casting: Main spell ability versus targets' defense, half damage when missed.]]}


zero_tips={n="Appendix 2: Advanced combat guide",d=[["Please, close this handbook and listen to me.

Just from your amateur standing pose could I bet that the quotations of someone suit you much better. You should read that first and practice some fighting before reading this handbook.

<s h3=c:lbl>
<h3>Details about two-weapon fighting / dual-wielding</h3>
Standard adjustment (main-hand/off-hand): <c=r>-6/-10</c>

With "Two-Weapon Fighting" feat: <c=g>+2/+6</c> (present adjustment: <c=r>-4/-4</c>)

Light weapon in off-hand: <c=g>+2/+2</c> (present adjustment: <c=r>-2/-2</c>)

With "Perfect Two-Weapon Fighting" feat: No penalty at all, even with a non-light weapon in off-hand (present adjustment: <c=r>0/0</c>).


<h3>Does "Two-Weapon Rending" feat works with dual hand-crossbows?</h3>
No it doesn't. "Two-Weapon Defense", "Improved Two-Weapon Defense", "Double Slice" and "Two-Weapon Rend" only work with melee dual-wielding.


<h3>How to make a charge?</h3>
A charge is automatically activated when all prerequisites are met: before a melee attack, made a movement in a straight line from at least 2 squares away, with the entire path free of obstacles and difficult terrain.


<h3>Enchantment: Defending (Weapons only)</h3>
On melee weapons could there be a special enchantment: Defending - +x shield bonus on AC, it works somewhat like an equipped shield.

This bonus does not stack with the AC bonus of a real shield, so it suits more for characters with two-hand weapons or dual-wielding and without a shield.

It is a bit more complicated when the defending enchantment occurs on weapons are both melee and thrown, such as a javelin: the enchantment works normally when the weapon is used as a melee weapon; but takes no effect if the weapon is used for thrown.


<h3>Clerics' turn undead:</h3>
Turning Check: character level + Charisma modifier + Feat bonuses vs. target's Will defense + Turn Resistance


<h3>Sometimes there is no effect when casting a spell targeting outside of the vision.</h3>
Casting a spell need line of effect. If there are unseen obstacles blocking line of effect, the spell will just fail.


<h3>How do the obstacles, enemies and allies affect the battlefield?</h3>

Influences on movement:

Obstacles and non-restrained enemies will block your movement. You cannot go through.

Squares adjacent to non-restrained enemies are their <c=r>Zone of Control (ZoC)</c>, and you cannot go through. You should first move into such a square and stop, then wait for your next turn to continue moving.

Non-restrained enemies equipping melee weapons will attack any opponent trying to leave their ZoC, such attack is called <c=r>Opportunity Attack (OA)</c>. Changing position using <c=g>Shift</c> (1 square step) can prevent OAs.

Difficult terrain: terrain with minor obstacles or some spell effects (Web, Grease, etc.), and squares occupied by your allies or restrained enemies are all considered as difficult terrain. These terrain take double efforts to pass through, and <c=g>Shift</c> is not allowed on them.


Influences on attacking:

Obstacles and non-restrained enemies could affect your attacks if the target is under <c=r>Cover</c> (attack <c=r>-2</c>) or <c=r>Superior Cover</c> (attack <c=r>-4</c>); they could also block your area of attack, including ranged attacks and spells.

Allies and restrained enemies will not affect your attack area and bonuses.</s>]]}

faq=[[<c=twa>Frequently Asked Questions

<s h3=c:tw>
<h3>Q: Nothing happens after video resolution changed?</h3>
A: Please restart the game.


<h3>Q: Can I choose the abilities and feats when levelling up?</h3>
A: Select "Custom" when creating a character and you are on your own. The "Premade" characters are designed for beginner players.


<h3>Q: How much is the maximum level?</h3>
A: Currently, there is no upper limit for levelling up in Arena mode. Nor does the Arena level.


<h3>Q: My skill bar is totally filled and I cannot see the new skills.</h3>
A: Right-click on the skill bar to replace and add new skills.
   Right-click on the character to select all available skills.


<h3>Q: How can I check the action sequence and other info of the combatants?</h3>
A: Press <b>Alt</b> key to see "<b>Action sequence</b>" and other infos.


<h3>Q: Can I use customized portraits and other resources?</h3>
A: All the game resources are open and you can edit/replace them freely.
   gfx folder: graphics
   sfx folder: music and sound effects
   text folder: texts. en for Engligh, cs for Chinese, etc.

You may also download more resources directly from <url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/576770/workshop/>Steam Workshop</url>.


<h3>Q: No need to reload a crossbow? It is imbalance that heavy crossbows are better than long bows in both range and damage.</h3>
A: Good suggestion. The point is that clicking for reload is annoying, and popping-out opportunity attack warnings are worse. Thus the reloading action is removed together with Rapid Reload feat.

There will be more feats to distinguish bows and crossbows in future version: bows are better for rapid shot and multiple targets, and crossbows for higher damage and piecing attack.


<h3>Q: Why are slings two-hand weapons? They are traditional one-hand weapons.</h3>
A: Yes, they are one-hand weapons but require two-hands to reload. It is enough to have hand crossbows as the typical one-hand ranged weapons.


<h3>Q: Why no running, feinting, aiding others and so on? The game will be much more interesting!</h3>
A: Yes, it will be. Yet the main focus now is simple and straightforward combat. We're working on a complicated action series like the Combat Maneuvers system of Pathfinder, and other options have to be added gradually with careful measure.

More options are not always welcome when they require too much time to find the best solution. They may slow down the combat flow. In ADnD TRPG, such case happens even without so much options. Here is a REAL example:

   The fighter: "Should I knock him down or push him away?"
   The rogue: "No pushing, I need to flank."
   The cleric: "That's risky. With one square shifting, we are all in his aura!"
   The rogue: "You step back. I could make a swapping-position blow."
   The wizard: "Or I can pull him closer."
   The fighter: "No you can't. That's a solid corner."
   The wizard: "I can move to here and pull. But the cleric should be off the line."
   The cleric: "I step back and the rogue will be smashed."
   
   Ten minutes later, they find the best move. The fighter rolls the dice with confidence. The result is MISS.

   "Time to rethink..."
