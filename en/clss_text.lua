s_clsx				="Multiclass Characters"	s_clsx_d	=[[A character may add new classes as she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from a character’s different classes combine to determine a multiclass character’s overall abilities. Multiclassing improves a character’s versatility at the expense of focus.


<h2 c=ty>Class and Level Features</h2>
As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum of the abilities of each of the character’s classes.

<b c=ty>Level:</b> “Character level” is a character’s total number of levels. It is used to determine when feats and ability score boosts are gained.

“Class level” is a character’s level in a particular class. For a character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level are the same.

<b c=ty>Hit Points:</b> Gain hit points from each class as the class level increases, adding the new hit points to the previous total.

<b c=ty>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each class to get the character’s base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the character with multiple attacks.

<b c=ty>Saving Throws:</b> Add the base save bonuses for each class together.

<b c=ty>Ability Increases:</b> Gain ability score increases based on character level, regardless of individual class level.

<b c=ty>Feats:</b> Gain feats based on character levels, regardless of individual class level.

<b c=ty>Skills:</b> Treat class skills of each class as class skills.

If a skill is a class skill for any of a multiclass character’s classes, then character level determines a skill’s maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)

If a skill is not a class skill for any of a multiclass character’s classes, the maximum rank for that skill is one-half the maximum for a class skill.

<b c=ty>Spells:</b> Gain spells from all of the character’s spellcasting classes and keeps a separate spell list for each class. If a spell’s effect is based on the class level of the caster, you must choose which class’s spell list the character is casting the spell from.

<b c=ty>Class Features:</b> Get all the class features of all her classes but must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all her classes. (Exception: A character who acquires the barbarian class does not become illiterate.)

<c=twa>For example, although rogues are proficient with light armor, a rogue/wizard still has an arcane spell failure chance if wearing armor.</c>

In the special case of turning undead, both clerics and experienced paladins have the same ability. If the character’s paladin level is 4th or higher, her effective turning level is her cleric level plus her paladin level minus 3.
<z>
In the special case of obtaining a familiar, both wizards and sorcerers have the same ability. A sorcerer/wizard stacks his sorcerer and wizard levels to determine the familiar’s natural armor, Intelligence score, and special abilities.
</z>
In the special case of uncanny dodge, both experienced barbarians and experienced rogues have the same ability. When a barbarian/rogue would gain uncanny dodge a second time (for her second class), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge, if she does not already have it.

Her barbarian and rogue levels stack to determine the rogue level an attacker needs to flank her.

<c=twa>For example, a 2nd-level barbarian/4th-level rogue could only be flanked by a rogue of at least 10th level.</c>


<h2 c=ty>Multiclass XP Penalty</h2>
Developing and maintaining skills and abilities in more than one class is a demanding process. Depending on the character’s class levels and race, he might or might not suffer an XP penalty.

If any two of a multiclass character’s classes are two or more levels apart, the strain of developing and maintaining different skills at different levels takes its toll. A multiclass character suffers a –20% penalty to XP for each class that is not within one level of his highest-level class.

A favored class (see the race entries) or a prestige class does not count for this penalty.]]

s_zaa_d	=[[Master of the elven warbands, the arcane archer is a warrior skilled in using magic to supplement her combat prowess. Beyond the woods, arcane archers gain renown throughout entire kingdoms for their supernatural accuracy with a bow and their ability to imbue their arrows with magic. In a group, they can strike fear into an entire enemy army.

Many who seek to perfect the use of the bow sometimes pursue the path of the arcane archer. Arcane archers are masters of ranged combat, as they possess the ability to strike at targets with unerring accuracy and can imbue their arrows with powerful spells. Arrows fired by arcane archers fly at weird and uncanny angles to strike at foes around corners, and can pass through solid objects to hit enemies that cower behind such cover. At the height of their power, arcane archers can fell even the most powerful foes with a single, deadly shot.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Those who have trained as both rangers and wizards excel as arcane archers, although other multiclass combinations are not unheard of. Fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians become arcane archers to add a little magic to their combat abilities. Conversely, wizards and sorcerers may take this prestige class to add combat capabilities to their repertoire. Monks, clerics, druids, rogues, and bards rarely become arcane archers.

<b>Role: </b>Arcane archers deal death from afar, winnowing down opponents while their allies rush into hand-to-hand combat. With their capacity to unleash hails of arrows on the enemy, they represent the pinnacle of ranged combat.

<b>Alignment: </b>Arcane archers can be of any alignment. Elf or half-elf arcane arches tend to be free-spirited and are rarely lawful. Similarly, it is uncommon for elven arcane archers to be evil, and overall the path of the arcane archer is more often pursued by good or neutral characters.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Arcane archers may be found wherever elves travel. Arcane archers often lead units of normal archers or form small, elite units formed entirely of arcane archers. These units are one of the prime reasons that the elves are so feared in battle.]]

s_zat	="Arcane Trickster"	s_zat_b	="A troublemaker and a scoundrel who uses arcane magic to enhance her thievery and trickery."
s_zat_d	=[[Few can match the guile and craftiness of arcane tricksters. These prodigious thieves blend the subtlest aspects of the arcane with the natural cunning of the bandit and the scoundrel, using spells to enhance their natural thieving abilities. Arcane tricksters can pick locks, disarm traps, and lift purses from a safe distance using their magical legerdemain, and as often as not seek humiliation as a goal to triumph over their foes than more violent solutions.

Arcane tricksters combine their knowledge of spells with a taste for intrigue, larceny, or just plain mischief. They are among the most adaptable of adventurers. Arcane tricksters tend to use a seat-of-the-pants approach to adventuring, loading up on spells that improve their stealth and mobility.


<b>Base Classes: </b>The path to becoming an arcane trickster is a natural progression for rogues who have supplemented their talents for theft with the study of the arcane. Arcane spellcasting and the sneak attack ability are needed to qualify for this class, making it a natural choice for multiclass wizard/rogues, sorcerer/rogues, or bard/rogues, although other combinations are possible. Assassins occasionally opt for this class, but usually only if they already have wizard or sorcerer levels.

<b>Role: </b>With their mastery of magic, arcane tricksters can make for even more subtle or confounding opponents than standard rogues. Ranged legerdemain enhances their skill as thieves, and their ability to make sneak attacks without flanking or as part of a spell can make arcane tricksters formidable damage-dealers.

<b>Alignment: </b>All arcane tricksters have a penchant for mischief and thievery, and are therefore never lawful. Although they sometimes acquire their magical abilities through the studious path of wizardry, their magical aptitude more often stems from a sorcerous bloodline. As such, many arcane tricksters are of a chaotic alignment.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Arcane tricksters are most often found in large, cosmopolitan cities where their talents for magical larceny can be most effectively put to use, prowling the streets and stealing from the unwary. An arcane trickster is just the sort of person that might bump into you in a crowded tavern. (Check your pockets.)]]

s_zam	="Archmage"	s_zam_b	="A great magical artist who bend spells in ways unavailable to other spellcasters."
s_zam_d	=[[The highest art is magic—often referred to as the Art. Its most advanced practitioners are frequently archmages, characters who bend spells in ways unavailable to other spellcasters. An archmage gains strange powers and the ability to alter spells in remarkable ways, but must sacrifice some of her spell capability in order to master these arcane secrets.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Most archmages are purely wizards or sorcerers. They rarely multiclass, choosing instead to concentrate on perfecting their arcane skills.

<b>Role: </b>It's rare to see an archmage in an adventure. For the archmage, time spent outside of arcane research is an absolute waste. Sometimes individual archmages who will temporarily join up with other adventurers for special purposes. In battle, as long as the front line does not fall, the archmage can provide the group with endless and unparalleled arcane firepower in the back row.

<b>Alignment: </b>Like arcane itself, there is no good or evil, morality, duty or emotion in the archmage's code, the only thing worth spending time on is arcane. Archmages are usually neutral. The world may divide archmages into specific alignments according to what they do, and either be grateful to them or hate them. All of these are meaningless to an archmage, but are just additional effects of his arcane quests.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Archmages in urban areas often hold positions of power in magic-focused guilds. Their pursuit of arcane excellence and their familiarity with high arcana place them above most of their peers. Some archmages choose a more solitary path, often eschewing society to study in quietude.]]

s_zas	="Assassin"	s_zas_b	="A remorseless murderer who kills for money and the sheer thrill of death-dealing."
s_zas_d	=[[A mercenary undertaking his task with cold, professional detachment, the assassin is equally adept at espionage, bounty hunting, and terrorism. At his core, an assassin is an artisan, and his medium is death. Trained in a variety of killing techniques, assassins are among the most feared classes.

The assassin is the master of dealing quick, lethal blows. Assassins also excel at infiltration and disguise. Assassins often function as spies, informants, killers for hire, or agents of vengeance. Their training in anatomy, stealth, poison, and the dark arts allows them to carry out missions of death with shocking, terrifying precision.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Most rogues, monks, and bards who choose this class become examples of the classic assassin skulking in the shadows with a blade carrying certain death. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, druids, and barbarians operate as warrior assassins, with as much ability to kill in combat as from the shadows. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics may be the most terrifying assassins of all, for with their spells they can infiltrate and slay with even greater impunity. While nearly any class is capable of becoming an assassin, rogues suit the part more than any other, from both an ability viewpoint and an ideological one. Though they make excellent allies during combat, assassins excel in more clandestine situations, and the best assassins are the ones the victims never knew existed.

<b>Role: </b>Assassins tend to be loners by nature, seeing companions as liabilities at best. Sometimes an assassin's missions put him in the company of adventurers for long stretches at a time, but few people are comfortable trusting a professional assassin to watch their backs in a fight, and are more likely to let the emotionless killer scout ahead or help prepare ambushes.

<b>Alignment: </b>Due to its necessary selfishness and callous indifference toward taking lives, the assassin class attracts those with evil alignments more than any others. Because the profession requires a degree of self-discipline, chaotic characters are ill suited to becoming these shadowy killers. Neutral characters sometimes become assassins, frequently thinking of themselves as simple professionals performing a job, yet the nature of their duties inevitably pushes them toward an evil alignment.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Assassins work in guilds or secret societies found hidden in cities or based in remote fortresses in the wilderness. Sometimes they serve more powerful evil characters singly or in a group. Occasionally an assassin works alone, but only the most capable are willing to operate without any sort of support or backup.]]

s_zbg	="Blackguard"	s_zbg_b	="A symbol of evil and a mortal fiend, the blackguard is the antithesis of the paladin."
s_zbg_d	=[[The blackguard epitomizes evil. He is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains antipaladins due to their completely evil nature.

The blackguard has many options available to him — sending forth dark minions and servants to do his bidding, attacking with stealth and honorless guile, or straightforward smiting of the forces of good that stand in his way.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, monks, druids, and barbarians make for indomitable combat-oriented blackguards, while rogues and bards who become blackguards are likely to stress the subtle aspects of their abilities and spells. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who become blackguards are sometimes called diabolists and favor dealing with fiends even more than other blackguards do.

<b>Role: </b>The moment a living person sees a blackguard is usually the last moment of his life, and there is basically no place for these evil warriors in a normal adventuring party. Occasionally some adventurers are forced by circumstances to work with a blackguard, in disgust and alienation at the same time they can not deny the blackguard's strength at the front of the group.

<b>Alignment: </b>The blackguard is indisputably of an evil alignment. Blood, plague, disaster and destruction, these lingering infamies determine the blackguard has no connection with good even neutral. Blackguards usually tend to be chaotic, a few obey more powerful evil presence and tend to be lawful.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Blackguards usually lead legions of undead, evil outsiders, or other monsters to conquer their own doomed demesne or expand their existing territory. Sometimes they serve more powerful evil characters as dark lieutenants. On occasion they operate alone as hired killers or wandering purveyors of ill, destruction, and chaos.]]

s_zdr	="Dragon Disciple"	s_zdr_b	="An arcane spellcaster who has embraced his latent draconic heritage and, over the course of training and devotion, undergoes a partial transformation into a dragon."
s_zdr_d	=[[As some of the most ancient, powerful, and capricious creatures in existence, dragons occasionally enter into trysts with unsuspecting mortals or sire offspring with exceptional individuals. Every child of this union unto the thousandth generation claims a bit of dragon blood, be it ever so small. Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic; for others, however, the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession.

Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer but also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their forebears, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and—at the pinnacle of their abilities—assume the form of a dragon.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Most dragon disciples are barbarians, fighters, or rangers who have dabbled as sorcerers or bards. Occasionally, a serious spellcaster explores the path to further a goal of finding out more about his draconic heritage, though at the expense of most of his arcane studies. Clerics and druids rarely choose to become dragon disciples. Already adept at magic, many pursue adventure, especially if it furthers their goal of finding out more about their draconic heritage.

<b>Role: </b>With the magic of a spellcasting class at their disposal, dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a magic-user, hampering the movement of the enemy and hurling damage-dealing spells at their opponents. Dragon disciples' draconic abilities, however, make these versatile spellcasters even more formidable, as they use their breath weapons and flight to destroy their foes directly.

<b>Alignment: </b>Those dragon disciples that assume the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial white and fearsome red dragons, have a proclivity for evil. Conversely, those that take after the metallic dragons, such as stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons, are often of good alignments.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Dragon disciples prefer a life of exploration to a cloistered existence. Dragon disciples are drawn to areas known to harbor dragons. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.]]

s_zdu	="Duelist"	s_zdu_b	="A swashbuckling swordfighter who relies upon grace, poise, and acrobatics to win the day."
s_zdu_d	=[[The duelist (sometimes known as the swashbuckler) is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier. Duelists are often found in those regions that possess elaborate rules and etiquette for battle.

Duelists represent the pinnacle of elegant swordplay. They move with a grace unmatched by most foes, parrying blows and countering attacks with swift thrusts of their blades. They thrive in melee, where their skill with the blade allows them to make sudden attacks against clumsy foes and to cripple opponents with particularly well-placed thrusts of the blade.

Duelists always take full advantage of their quick reflexes and wits in fights. Rather than wearing bulky armor, duelists feel the best way to protect themselves is not to get hit at all. While others flounder on treacherous terrain, duelists charge nimbly across the battlefield, leaping and tumbling into the fray.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Duelists are most often fighters or rangers, but almost as often are rogues or bards. Wizards, sorcerers, and monks make surprisingly good duelists due to those classes’ lack of reliance on armor. They benefit greatly from the weapon skill the duelist offers. Some paladins and barbarians who deviate a good deal from their archetypes become duelists.

<b>Role: </b>The abilities of duelists complement those rogues or bards who wish to accentuate their fighting prowess but, because of their lack of heavy armor, are afraid to leap into combat. Duelists fight in the forefront alongside fighters, barbarians, and other melee combatants, deftly avoiding the blades of their opponents while expertly targeting their vulnerabilities.

<b>Alignment: </b>Duelists can be of any alignment, although since most hail from backgrounds as rogues or bards, they tend to eschew lawful behavior. Lawful duelists are not unheard of, however, and such duelists often adhere to a strict code of honor, refusing to attack unarmed or obviously inferior opponents.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Duelists are usually loners looking for adventure or a get-rich-quick scheme. Occasionally they work in small, tight-knit groups, fighting with team-based tactics.]]

A line of dwarven defenders is a far better defense than a 10-foot-thick wall of stone, and much more dangerous. When dwarven defenders set themselves in a defensive stance, they place their whole effort into weathering whatever foe, conflict, or threat comes their way.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Most dwarven defenders are fighters, paladins, rangers, or clerics, often those desiring to be better guards for friends and allies, although ex-barbarians, sorcerers, wizards, and druids can certainly all benefit from the defensive capabilities of this prestige class. Rogues, bards, and monks usually depend too heavily on mobility to use the abilities of the dwarven defender class to their fullest.

<b>Role: </b>Dwarven defenders are masters of melee combat, striving to prove that the best offense is a good defense. They are normally found on the front lines of battle, holding a position to cover their allies, leaping into breaches of opposing formations and holding them open for others, and guarding more vulnerable allies by acting as mobile fortifications, stable points in the ever-changing chaos of battle.

<b>Alignment: </b>Dwarven defenders can be as stubborn as a rock and dedicated to holding one point no matter the cost. A strong respect for order and organization is essential for learning the talents of a dwarven defender, so dwarven defenders are always lawful.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Dwarven defenders are usually soldiers in a dwarven citadel, segregated into their own units separate from regular warriors or fighters. Occasionally a lone, wandering dwarven defender can be encountered on some mission, although he usually guards his words so closely that it’s difficult to learn what his quest actually entails.]]

s_zek	="Eldritch Knight"	s_zek_b	="An arcane spellcaster who augments his magical skills with combat to create a deadly combination of weapons and magic."
s_zek_d	=[[Fearsome warriors and spellcasters, eldritch knights are rare among magic-users in their ability to wade into battle alongside fighters, barbarians, and other martial classes. Those who must face eldritch knights in combat fear them greatly, for their versatility on the battlefield is tremendous; against heavily armed and armored opponents they may level crippling spells, while opposing spellcasters meet their ends on an eldritch knight's blade.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Because the road to becoming an eldritch knight requires both martial prowess and arcane power, eldritch knights almost always begin their paths as multiclassed characters, with fighter/wizard the most common combination. A few eldritch knights were once bards, and even paladin/sorcerers aren’t unheard of. They may be found wherever studies of the arcane are as prevalent as martial training.

<b>Role: </b>Eldritch knights blend the abilities of fighting classes and spellcasters, hurling magic at the enemy one moment and hewing down their opponents with steel the next. They are just as comfortable fighting in the thick of combat as they are casting spells at foes while remaining safely behind their compatriots. Their versatility makes them valuable allies when the nature of an upcoming battle is unclear.

<b>Alignment: </b>The road to becoming an eldritch knight is as varied as the paths leading to apprenticeship under a wizard or a career as a soldier, and eldritch knights can therefore be of any alignment. Maintaining a balance between studies of arcane lore and martial techniques requires great discipline, however, and for that reason many favor lawful alignments.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Eldritch knights can be found wherever there’s a good fight or the promise of arcane lore. They find higher-level fighters and wizards particularly interesting, and some eldritch knights apprentice themselves for a time to learn the finer points of arcane technique or weapons prowess. Eldritch knights split their time between physical training to become better soldiers and arcane study to learn more powerful spells. They tend to be driven individuals, because simultaneously perfecting their spellcasting and combat prowess requires immense time and effort. Eldritch knights are never truly at home among arcane spellcasters or elite soldiers, so many drift from wizard school to mercenary unit to band of adventurers.]]

s_zhi	="Hierophant"	s_zhi_b	="A divine spellcaster who rises high in the service of his deity."
s_zhi_d	=[[A divine spellcaster who rises high in the service of his deity gains access to spells and abilities of which lesser faithful can only dream. The hierophant prestige class is open to powerful divine spellcasters who are approaching access to the strongest and most difficult divine spells. They delay the acquisition of these greatest gifts in exchange for a deeper understanding of and ability to control the power they channel.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Most hierophants were clerics or druids. Some may have pursued another divine spellcasting-focused prestige class. Hierophants rarely multiclass into non-spellcasting classes.

<b>Role: </b>The hierophant spends most time performing his duties and rarely gets involved with adventures. Occasionally, because of holy quests hierophants may join up with an adventuring party. A hierophant is a powerful ally for any group, providing divine support in all aspects of offense, defense, enhancing and healing.

<b>Alignment: </b>Hierophants usually tend to be lawful good, but it is not uncommon for divine spellcasters to serve evil deities and thus qualify for this prestige class.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Hierophants are usually high-ranking members of a church or druidic circle. Most are exemplary representatives of their faith.]]

s_zhw	="Horizon Walker"	s_zhw_b	="A scout and wanderer comfortable in even the strangest terrain."
s_zhw_d	=[[The horizon walker is an unceasing traveler to the universe’s most dangerous places. As her journeys take her from place to place, she adapts to become one with her environment. In time, she develops a mystic connection with the ground beneath her. But she is by no means tied to a particular place; her restless feet are ever leading her toward the horizon, where new adventures await.

Horizon walkers are masters of travel, always seeking to find the safe ways through inhospitable terrain. They are comfortable in places others speak of only in hushed whispers, and they can both venture forth onto untrod paths themselves and guide the less-traveled through such hazardous lands.

Horizon walkers tend to be hard to surprise or impress, because they’ve seen so many wonders during their travels. It’s common for a horizon walker to have an outward attitude of “been there, done that.” But horizon walkers are gripped by an unquenchable wanderlust, so they’re always in the midst of a journey or planning their next one. As they travel, horizon walkers develop a magical resonance with the terrain that surrounds them, making them unparalleled guides and scouts. And they’re formidable foes when their travels take them into danger, able to use the terrain they know so well to good advantage.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Those whose wanderlust drives them to push the boundary of safe environments sometimes seek the calling of the horizon walker. Rangers and bards take up the path of the horizon walker more often than other characters, but that’s more because they appreciate the wanderer’s life, not because the path of the horizon walker is particularly specialized. A fair number of horizon walkers were barbarians who strayed from their native lands or rogues who found their skills useful on the road. Occasionally a druid will adopt the prestige class, though most are loath to do so because they sacrifice their spellcasting advancement.

<b>Role: </b>Horizon walkers have the accuracy and resilience to face frontline combat. They also have the skills and abilities to make excellent scouts, often taking the role of the first member of a group into danger and the last one out. Of course, walkers shine when adventuring in areas that match their many favored terrains, but many of the tricks they pick up in specific regions have application in a wide range of situations, allowing a horizon walker to be more mobile and resourceful than typical combatants.

<b>Alignment: </b>Anyone can crave new vistas and constant travel, and thus a horizon walker can be of any alignment.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>You’ll find horizon walkers on the road, or in places so forbidding that roads don’t exist. Horizon walkers are most common in areas on the edge of civilization, where they can easily spend time away from the known and boring streets of settled lands. They rarely stay in one place for long, and they’re eager to launch a new expedition—the more exotic and remote the destination, the better.]]

s_zlm	="Loremaster"	s_zlm_b	="A spellcaster who devotes his life to research and rumination upon the mysteries of the world."
s_zlm_d	=[[Loremasters are spellcasters who concentrate on knowledge, valuing lore and secrets over gold. They uncover secrets that they then use to better themselves mentally, physically, and spiritually.

The loremaster is a gatherer and keeper of secrets. He is often obsessed by the written word, with cryptic and arcane lore serving as his devoted mistress. Holding to the adage that knowledge is power, the loremaster often forsakes material wealth and personal glory for rare or unusual information, an endless quest that brings him ever closer to his unattainable goal: perfection through edification. Often rejecting what he views as the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of his short-sighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might. After all, wealth is spent, passions fade, and the power of the body is limited by age, while the mind's capacity to grow greater with time is infinite.


<b>Base Classes: </b>The loremaster class holds little appeal for non-spellcasters—indeed, before one can devote a life to the studies and traditions of the loremaster, a character must first master several spells of the school of divination. Most loremasters begin their paths as clerics or wizards, but any character capable of casting enough divination spells can, eventually, become a loremaster. However, characters without at least one level of wizard, sorcerer, cleric, or druid gain little benefit for becoming a loremaster. Paladins, rangers, and bards might gain some benefit, but overall, it would be minor.

<b>Role: </b>Loremasters' lives are spent in study, research, and fieldwork. While the first two lend themselves to the loremaster's reputation as a bookish recluse, the latter oftentimes forces a loremaster to seek out the aid of adventurers who, through a mutually beneficial arrangement, might provide a degree of protection to the scholar while he seeks whatever knowledge he is after. For his part, the loremaster provides a wealth of information and arcane firepower to a party. Some loremasters actively deride those of their kind who fear to leave the safety of the temple or library, pointing out that only old lore can be discovered in books—new lore must be sought out in the world. These more active loremasters might join up with an adventuring party for the benefit of the journey, content with whatever knowledge might be picked up along the way.

<b>Alignment: </b>Most loremasters cannot be bothered with distracting and pointless philosophies such as ethics, and so tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Loremasters sometimes gather in secluded cabals but are more often found as members of an order attached to a university, a library, or some other source of information. They’re likely to earn extra money as sages and information brokers, pouring their wages into their own research. A loremaster might also adopt a position as a wise one in a community, or even as its leader, drawing upon her knowledge to help others.]]

s_zmt	="Mystic Theurge"	s_zmt_b	="Equally devoted to divine and arcane magic, the mystic theurge combines both magical traditions into one incredibly diverse class."
s_zmt_d	=[[Blurring the line between divine and arcane, mystic theurges draw power from divine sources and musty tomes alike. Mystic theurges place no boundaries on their magical abilities and find no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as well as the divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations, mystic theurges believe that perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself.

While most spellcasters choose one path to magical power, mystic theurges walk two roads at once, simultaneously mastering spells common to clerics and wizards. Mystic theurges have unparalleled diversity of spells. In time, a mystic theurge can cast almost all spells. While a mystic theurge doesn’t have the uninterrupted spell advancement that a cleric, wizard, or sorcerer has, he makes up for this with versatility.

Mystic theurges are drawn from multiclass spellcasters who can already cast both arcane and divine spells, and the powers that they gain increase their mastery over both.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Because a mystic theurge casts both arcane and divine spells, all members of this class are multiclass spellcasters. Cleric/sorcerers and cleric/wizards are the most common mystic theurges, with druid/sorcerers more rare and druid/wizards almost unheard of.

<b>Role: </b>The mystic theurge is a powerful component for any party, supplying magic for attack, defense, and healing. Mystic theurges travel the world in search of arcane and holy artifacts, magical lore, or divine revelations, and most have no qualms about teaming up with groups of adventurers so long as that group's goals do not directly conflict with their own.

<b>Alignment: </b>The motivations of a mystic theurge rarely stem from a sense of altruism or philanthropy, so most tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. Lawful mystic theurges, whether good, neutral, or evil, are rarer, and often use their powers for either the benefit—or control—of society. Chaotic mystic theurges are rarer still, as the calling generally requires great personal discipline.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Mystic theurges are often obsessed with magical lore, traveling to the ends of the earth to learn some new arcane secret or divine insight. Mystic theurges tend to be fascinated with magic in whatever form it takes. They’re always on the hunt for powerful magic items and new arcane spells. Those mystic theurges who worship a deity use the power of their spellcasting to further their deity’s agenda.]]

s_zsd	="Shadowdancer"	s_zsd_b	="A mysterious adventurer who walks the boundaries between the real world and the realm of shadows, and who can command shadows to do her bidding."
s_zsd_d	=[[Civilized folk have always feared the night, barring themselves behind doors or comforting themselves with bonfires when the shadows grow long, rightfully wary of the creatures that prowl the darkness. Yet long ago, some learned that the best way to conquer an enemy is to embrace it. These were the first shadowdancers.

Shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness, where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists of deception. They are mysterious and unknown, never completely trusted but always inducing wonder when met.

Unbound by any specified morality or traditional code, shadowdancers encompass a wide variety of adventuring types who have seen the value of the dark. Spellcasters use their abilities to safely cast spells from hiding and then move quickly away, while classes devoted to hand-to-hand combat enjoy the ability to attack foes with the element of surprise. Some even take the name of their kind quite literally, becoming eerie and mysterious performers and dancers, though more often the temptation presented by their talents with deception and infiltration causes shadowdancers to turn to lives of thievery.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Rogues, bards, and monks make excellent shadowdancers. Fighters, barbarians, rangers, and paladins also find that shadowdancer abilities allow them to strike at their opponents with surprise and skill. Wizard, sorcerer, cleric, and druid shadowdancers employ the defensive capabilities inherent in the prestige class to allow them to cast their spells from safety and move away quickly. Despite their link with shadows and trickery, shadowdancers are as often good as evil.

<b>Role: </b>Shadowdancers adventure for a wide variety of reasons. Many adventuring parties find shadowdancers valuable members of their teams due to their incredible stealth and ability to surprise enemies with lightning-quick attacks where they're least expected. For this reason, their services are often sought out by those groups in need of scouts or spies.

<b>Alignment: </b>Because of their nature as visually duplicitous tricksters, shadowdancers do not fit comfortably into the lawful category, as many use their talents to avoid the eyes of legitimate authority. Yet though they are allies of darkness, shadowdancers are neither inherently evil nor predisposed to good. To them, the darkness is simply the darkness, without any of the usual moral connotations made by the unenlightened.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Shadowdancers often work in troupes, never staying in one place too long. Some use their abilities to entertain. Others operate as thieves, using their abilities to infiltrate past defenses and dupe others. All shadowdancer troupes maintain an aura of mystery among the common folk, who never know whether to think well or ill of them.]]

s_ztt	="Thaumaturgist"	s_ztt_b	="Demons and devils, angels or eladrins, by virtue of divine power, the thaumaturgist can summon powerful planar allies to do his bidding."
s_ztt_d	=[[The thaumaturgist reaches out with divine power to other planes of existence, calling creatures there to do his bidding. Evil thaumaturgists conspire with demons and devils to gain power on the Material Plane, while good thaumaturgists send powerful angels or eladrins on holy quests.

In combat, thaumaturgists often summon creatures from the Outer Planes to fight on their behalf. These creatures fade away as soon as the battle is over, but thaumaturgists also make agreements with more powerful creatures for long-term service. The planar ally of a thaumaturgist is utterly devoted to furthering the thaumaturgist’s goals (or the goals of a deity, if the thaumaturgist worships one).


<b>Base Classes: </b>Almost all thaumaturgists were once clerics, because the first step on the path of thaumaturgy is making an agreement with a denizen of the Outer Planes by use of the lesser planar ally spell. But many of the class abilities are useful to arcane spellcasters, so multiclass cleric/wizards and the occasional cleric/sorcerer aren’t unheard of.

<b>Role: </b>The extraordinary summoning ability makes the thaumaturgist popular among adventurer groups. In combat, the thaumaturgist summons powerful planar allies to act as a front-line of the party, while he provides magical support to the group from the back row.

<b>Alignment: </b>Thaumaturgists can be of any alignment, although they tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those thaumaturgists who make pacts with demons or devils usually tend to be evil, while those who are close to angels or eladrins are often of good alignments. It is not uncommon for thaumaturgists to be neutral.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>A thaumaturgist is keenly aware that his unparalleled conjurations are just tools in service of his overall philosophy or deity. Thus, thaumaturgists often undertake quests to advance a cause, using their abilities to conjure up a strike force of summoned and called creatures at a moment’s notice.]]

A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other called creatures normally. A planar cohort replaces a thaumaturgist’s existing cohort, if he has one by virtue of the Leadership feat.]]


-- zbm	剑圣			Blade Master
s_zbm	="Blade Master"		s_zbm_b	="A warrior who dedicated his life to the mastery of a single weapon."
s_zbm_d	=[[Class differences aside, adventurers usually have some sort of preference for weapons. Some prefer the heavy greatsword, others prefer the fine, handy rapier or kukri, but few have an obsession with a certain kind of weapon to the extent of blade masters.

Blade masters focus their lifelong training on a single weapon (usually a sword), called favored weapon. Throughout his career, the blade master relentlessly seeks the mastery of the weapon, seeking to wield it without thought as any other limb, and ultimately to unite the weapon with the body, to make them one.

Although the blade master can choose any weapon as his favored weapon, he usually selects a weapon from the sword category. Compared to other weapons, swords with high critical rates are more suitable for the blade master's special abilities.


<b>Base Classes: </b>Most blade masters are fighters. Many of the blade master's class abilities are in the same vein as the fighter's specific feats, and further perfected and sublimated. Characters of other combat classes can also benefit from this prestige class, but not as well suited as the fighter.

<b>Role: </b>The blade master is the sharpest sword of a party, tearing apart the enemy's formation and cutting off their leader's head. Compared to other combat classes, the blade master focuses more on offense than defense.

<b>Alignment: </b>Blade masters can be of any alignment, but usually tend to be lawful, because the path to becoming a blade master requires strong concentration and self-discipline.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>Blade masters rarely appear in public, and spend most of their time alone in secluded places honing their skills. However, do not be mistaken that they have no communication with the outside world, training behind closed doors is never a good way to practice martial arts. In fact, most blade masters come from professional academies that have extensive communication with all walks of life, and only a few are trained individually under the tutelage of an established blade master. In addition, many blade masters are also famous swordsmiths, and like to forge their favored weapons with their own hands.]]

-- zel	元素领主		Elemental Lord
s_zel	="Elemental Lord"		s_zel_b	="An arcane spellcaster who has a powerful elemental companion and can turn himself into an elemental."
s_zel_d	=[[For arcane spellcasters, the endless mysteries contained in the Outer Planes have a fatal allure, especially those of the Elemental Planes. Summon elemental spells or rituals known to adventurers, and the overwhelming combat advantage brought by a variety of powerful elemental allies, all attracted many spellcasters to indulge in.

The elemental lord takes it a step further. Years of intense research and even fieldwork have made the elemental lord more knowledgeable about all aspects of elementals than other spellcasters. He has studied the ways, means, origins, and formation of elementals, and instinctively knows an elemental’s strengths and develops an unbreakable bond with a powerful elemental companion.

Elemental companions are usually summoned through spells or rituals, and then bargained and contracted for a longer-term partnership. However, rumor has it that some radical elemental lords are deeply uncomfortable with this, and they consider it too hasty, even a sacrilege to do so. They prefer to spend huge amounts of resources, through various means, to reach the Elemental Planes, in order to an official visit and negotiate a partnership with the elemental of their choice, believing that the bond established in this way is more trustworthy.

Either way, as this bond deepens over time, the elemental lord's kinship with the elemental companion deepens, blurring the line between master and servant. Eventually, the journey of discovery made both stronger, and even the elemental lord himself transformed into an elemental and became part of the elemental forces.


<b>Base Classes: </b>The knowledge required to learn the secrets of the Outer Planes is arcane in nature, and thus this prestige class is filled mostly with wizards and sorcerers — though anyone else who meets the requirements may choose to take the journey of an elemental lord.

<b>Role: </b>Although rarely seen in adventure groups, once an elemental lord decided to become part of a group, with his powerful elemental companion, uncanny traits, and impressive spellcasting ability, in the front line or back row of the battlefield can be at ease, he will soon become reliable for other members.

<b>Alignment: </b>Similar to most arcane spellcasters who are addicted to a certain field of study, elemental lords spend their lives in pursuit of the mysteries of the Outer Planes and the way to live in harmony with elementals. They have no time for morals and ethics, which are meaningless to them, so they tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil.

<b>Non-adventurers: </b>With a reliable elemental companion by his side, the elemental lord usually embarks on the journey of discovery alone, no need to group with other adventurers, unless as a last resort. Most adventurer groups certainly welcome the addition of an elemental lord (plus a powerful ally).]]
