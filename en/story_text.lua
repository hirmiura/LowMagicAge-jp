tlks_meet_aileen_2_q="\"Hmm..... I feel dizzy. Who are you? Did you save me?\""
tlks_meet_aileen_2_a="\"I am {u=aileen}. We found you passed out along the beach. You're an adventurer, aren’t you? But not from this land...\" The lady looks you over and asks, \"Are you here alone or were you with companions?\""
tlks_meet_aileen_3_q="\"We?\""
tlks_meet_aileen_3_a="\"Oh, I’m sorry I forgot to tell you.\" The lady continued, \"My companion {u=tod} and I are both from the Adventurers Guild, we welcome adventurers from the eastern mainland. Perhaps your memory has not yet recovered? This all should have been explained in your invitation letter.\""
tlks_meet_aileen_4_q="\"What is this place?\""
tlks_meet_aileen_4_a="\"This is the nearest beach to {s=41}. {s=41} is not far from here. That is where you should have landed. Let us put aside further questions for now, important tasks lay ahead.\""
tlks_meet_aileen_5_q="\"I came with several adventurers. Did you see them?\""
tlks_meet_aileen_5_a="\"We only found you. My companion {u=tod} has been searching for others, but as of yet has uncovered no clues to where they may be. We must make haste to track them for many monsters wander along this stretch of coastline.\" {u=aileen} anxiously explains, \"We’d better prepare for a fight should you wish to save your companions. Are you ready?\""
tlks_meet_aileen_6_q="\"Yes, let's go at once. I don't want to risk losing any of my friends.\""
tlks_meet_aileen_7_q="\"There is something else that I should figure out.\""
tlks_meet_aileen_7_a="\"All right, but we have no time to waste.\""

tlks_meet_tod_1_a="\"{u=aileen}! Goblin!\" A young fighter rushes at you with two goblins trailing behind. Spears sail over his shoulders and impale the ground just in front of you."
tlks_meet_tod_2_q="Draw your weapons!"
tlks_meet_tod_3_q="\"What? Who are you?\""
tlks_meet_tod_3_a="\"Cut the bullshit, newblood! You take the little one!\" The man rolls his eyes."

tlks_meet_tod_2_1_a="\"These damned goblins!\" The young fighter must be the companion {u=tod} that {u=aileen} mentioned. After cursing the foul little beasts, {u=tod} reports the results of his search, \"Your companions have been taken away by a band of goblins. Unfortunately, the bulk of them broke camp by the time I picked up the trail. I killed two, no, three of them. The rest are no doubt with your friends.\""
tlks_meet_tod_2_2_q="\"How are my companions? Are they hurt??\""
tlks_meet_tod_2_2_a="\"Sorry, I couldn’t see them clearly from such a long distance. They were still on their feet, though, so I doubt any are gravely wounded.\""
tlks_meet_tod_2_3_q="\"What shall we do now?\""
tlks_meet_tod_2_3_a="\"We should move towards {s=227} immediately!\" {u=tod} says hastily, \"If we're lucky we'll reach {s=227} in time to save your companions.\""
tlks_meet_tod_2_4_q="\"Why {s=227}?\""
tlks_meet_tod_2_4_a="\"If they're headed in that direction they could only be bringing your friends to their lair {s=227}. The place crawls with goblins, but the guild can't spare the manpower to slay them all.\""

tlks_meet_thomas_1_a="After the battle, the man who looks like a soldier or maybe a guard exits the room, \"Thank you! These monsters would have surely broken through the door without your help.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_2_q="\"We are adventurers of the Adventurers Guild. What happened?\""
tlks_meet_thomas_2_a="\"I’m {u=thomas}, one of {u=brian} the banker's guards. We were ambushed on our way to {s=76}. My companion, {u=william}, and I were trapped in the building by monsters during the evacuation.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_3_q="\"Who are those monsters?\""
tlks_meet_thomas_3_a="\"They are halfling thieves!\" {u=thomas} replies bitterly, \"It’s strange to see skeleton warriors and skeleton archers present.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_4_q="\"Why strange? I thought them to be common monsters.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_4_a="\"Weak undead creatures like skeletons and zombies are not rare, but they should be among their own wretched kind. I’ve never seen such undead fiends work alongside the civilized races before.\" {u=thomas} shakes his head displaying a bitter smile, \"I don’t know what’s going on with this world.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_5_q="\"So you know about the undead?\""
tlks_meet_thomas_5_a="\"Haha! I'm no expert.\", {u=thomas} responds, \"Actually, my uncle was a cleric and he taught me a few things about them as a boy. Basics tactics like using blunt weapons against skeletons. As a cleric he even possessed the ability to turn the undead, though you can't teach faith.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_6_q="\"Where is the banker, {u=brian}, now?\""
tlks_meet_thomas_6_a="\"Most of the guards escorted {u=brian} during the evacuation towards {s=138}. However, with so many enemies about, I've got a bad feeling.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_7_q="\"We were sent to investigate what happened and provide protection.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_7_a="\"Thank god! I was helpless just now, {u=william} was seriously injured and should be taken immediately to the nearest town. Since you seek to rescue {u=brian}, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief and send {u=william} to the town now.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_8_q="\"Just provide us with all the information you know. Please, it would be of great assistance.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_8_a="\"For sure. {s=138} is here on the map,\" {u=thomas} says while marking the location upon our adventure map. \"Also, I've got a morningstar for you, just in case you encounter skeletons.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_9_q="\"Thank you. We will set off on the rescue at once!\""
tlks_meet_thomas_10_q="\"I've got another question.\""
tlks_meet_thomas_10_a="\"OK.\""

tlks_banker_thank_1_1_a="\"Thank you! I never expected help to come.\" Upon conveying what happened to {u=brian}, he solemnly expresses his gratitude."
tlks_banker_thank_1_2_q="\"Only you survived in your troop?\""
tlks_banker_thank_1_2_a="\"I'm not sure. We were split up and there were so many enemies. Several of my guards were slain and afterwards I was caught by the assailants.\""
tlks_banker_thank_1_3_q="\"Do you know anything about these assailants?\""
tlks_banker_thank_1_3_a="\"I don't know why those halflings would've attack my troops. I didn't hear anything useful upon being caught as they only spoke in their own language.\""
tlks_banker_thank_1_4_q="\"Anything about those skeletons?\""
tlks_banker_thank_1_4_a="\"Ah, I did see several of those midgets ordering some skeletons about in the common tongue. They held onto a strange device as they did it. Some artifact of magic that glowed an evil shade of violet.\""
tlks_banker_thank_1_5_q="\"Our mission is to escort you safely to {s=76}, let's go.\""

tlks_banker_thank_2_1_a="\"Finally, there we are!\" {u=brian} takes a deep breath upon arriving at the gate, \"I didn’t expect this {s=76} trip to be so long and dangerous. I should get ready to set up the first bank on the Alrthia continent. I owe the safe return of my guards to your Adventurers Guild, thanks a lot!\""
tlks_banker_thank_2_2_q="\"What services from the bank? Can adventurers use it?\""
tlks_banker_thank_2_2_a="\"For sure.\" {u=brian} seems refreshed talking about the bank. \"Both law-abiding citizens and brave adventurers are entitled to enjoy our services. Our safe deposit boxes are the most secure way to store your gold.\""
tlks_banker_thank_2_3_q="\"Which city do you have in mind for the first bank?\""
tlks_banker_thank_2_3_a="\"It’s still up in the air, we should consider the final investigation results. I think it might be one of the larger cities, if nothing goes wrong.\""
tlks_banker_thank_2_4_q="\"How many banks are planned to be set up on the Alrthia continent?\""
tlks_banker_thank_2_4_a="\"The more, the better!\" {u=brian} says with a smile, \"Actually, it depends. A few big cities will be selected for operation at the initial stage. If we get good performance, we will gradually expand to more cities.\""
